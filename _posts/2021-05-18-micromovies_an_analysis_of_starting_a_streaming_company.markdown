Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 

They have hired me to help them better understand the movie industry. My team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

Based on our initial research, we'll want to answer three questions: 
* What movies have the highest foreign percentage?
* How many of the top grossing movies are a part of a franchise, sequel or nostalgia?
* What are the highest grossing MPAA ratings?

Due to COVID, we decided to utilize the pre-COVID [Top 100 highest grossing box office numbers of 2019](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-2019) for our analysis. With this, we'll be able to demonstrate where Microsoft should invest their resources for starting MicroMovies.

### What movies have the highest foreign percentage? 

We'll use International Share to show the percentage of the Worldwide Box Office comes from International Box Office.

#### Most of the highest grossing films get anywhere between 40% - 100% of their revenue from international box office.


### How many of the top grossing movies are a part of a franchise, sequel or nostalgia?

#### Most of the highest grossing films are also a part of a franchise or a remake (selling nostalgia).


With international being so significant in the success of a film, if MicroMovies were to start a film that wasn't already a part of an established franchise or a remake, it would still be a good use of resourses. Films that were not a part of a franchise had over 70% of it's revenue come from international box office.

### What are the highest grossing MPAA ratings?

#### G Rated movies performed by far the best in terms of the highest grossing films on average across the board.

Based on the analysis, these are the recommendations my team have for starting MicroMovies:

1. The film script, characters, and theme need to appeal to an international audience.
2. . MicroMovies should do some research on shows, movies or books that could be adapted into a film.
3. . In the MicroMovies search, they should prioritze films that are G rated.

### Next Steps
MicroMovies should do research on which international countries account for the highest percentage of international box office share.
